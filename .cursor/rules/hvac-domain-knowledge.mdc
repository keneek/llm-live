# HVAC Commissioning Domain Knowledge

This application implements professional HVAC commissioning and envelope testing procedures with real-time engineering calculations.

## Test Type Categories

### Envelope Tests (A1-A4)
- **A1 BUILDING_PRESSURE**: Target 0.02-0.05 in. w.c. (inches water column)
- **A2 PRESSURE_DECAY**: Envelope tightness over time  
- **A3 RETURN_CURB_LEAKAGE**: Smoke testing for return air leaks
- **A4 SLAB_WALL_MOISTURE**: Plastic sheet test and IR imaging

### HVAC Tests (B1-B6)  
- **B1 AIRFLOW_STATIC**: CFM measurements and static pressure
- **B2 REFRIGERANT_CIRCUIT**: Superheat and subcooling analysis
- **B3 COIL_PERFORMANCE**: Temperature/humidity across evaporator coil
- **B4 FAN_EVAP_RECHECK**: Post-adjustment verification
- **B5 ECONOMIZER_SEAL**: Damper leakage testing
- **B6 DISTRIBUTION_MIXING**: Zone temperature/humidity uniformity

## Key Engineering Calculations

### CFM/Ton Ratios ([src/lib/calculations.ts](mdc:src/lib/calculations.ts))
- **Target for dehumidification**: 350-400 CFM/ton
- **Formula**: `supplyCFM / tons`
- **Pass/Fail**: Automatic validation with recommendations

### Dew Point Calculations  
- **Formula**: Magnus formula from dry bulb temperature and relative humidity
- **Supply air target**: 50-55°F for good dehumidification
- **Used in**: Coil performance and distribution testing

### Refrigerant Analysis
- **Superheat**: Suction line temp - saturation temp at suction pressure
- **Subcooling**: Saturation temp at liquid pressure - liquid line temp  
- **Acceptable ranges**: 8-15°F (varies by outdoor conditions)
- **Indicates**: Refrigerant charge level and system performance

## Pass/Fail Criteria ([src/lib/test-computations.ts](mdc:src/lib/test-computations.ts))
All test types have built-in acceptance criteria based on ASHRAE standards and industry best practices. The system automatically determines pass/fail status and provides actionable recommendations for failed tests.
